## eZ Platform is now Ibexa DXP

Going forward from version 3.2 eZ Platform (Enterprise Edition) will be known as the [Ibexa DXP technology](https://www.ibexa.co/products) that is the base for three products: [Ibexa Content](https://www.ibexa.co/products/ibexa-content), [Ibexa Experience](https://www.ibexa.co/products/ibexa-experience) and [Ibexa Commerce](https://www.ibexa.co/products/ibexa-commerce). Instructions in this code should be relevant since Ibexa DXP is an evolution of eZ Platform, not a revolution. Learn more from the [Ibexa DXP v3.2 launch post](https://www.ibexa.co/blog/product-launch-introducing-ibexa-dxp-3.2) and the [Ibexa developer portal](https://developers.ibexa.co).
